boolean_pdf program user guide

This program will search through the text of each PDF file in the folder the presence of user-defined words. The output file will read "TRUE" if that word is found at least once in the PDF text and "FALSE" if not.

3) Double-click on the boolean_pdf.R file to open it in RStudio.
4) Click the button that has a white square with a blue arrow pointing to the word "Source". This should run the program.
5) When prompted in the console (bottom left), click anywhere on the console and then follow the instructions to enter your keywords.
6) The program will create a cvs file called "Boolean_results.csv" in the pdf folder. This can be opened in Microsoft Excel.
